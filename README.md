# Robust-Banking-System-with-Hashmap
This project implements a banking system using a HashMap data structure, offering efficient operations for creating accounts, retrieving balances, adding transactions, checking account existence, and deleting accounts.

# Key Features:

->**Account Creation:** Users can create new accounts efficiently through the system.
->**Balance Retrieval:** The system provides quick access to the balance of a given account.
->**Transaction Management:** Users can seamlessly add transactions to their accounts, ensuring accurate record-keeping.
->**Account Existence Verification:** The system efficiently checks whether an account exists based on the provided account number.
->**Account Deletion:** Users have the ability to delete accounts, ensuring flexibility and data management.

This project leverages the HashMap data structure to achieve optimal performance in terms of time complexity for key banking operations. With its clean and efficient design, it offers a robust solution for basic banking functionalities.
